            <p>Iâ€™m a full stack Software Engineer, my current stack is the PERN stack (PostgresSQL, Express, React, and Node). I joined the military right out of high school at 18 years old and three of the biggest things I learn from the military is independance, leadership and problem solving. One of the reason I wanted to become a Software Engineer was because I love to problem solve, so towards the end of my military I realized I wanted to do something more, and decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp, where I realized I really love coding and problem solving. I think learning new technologies and making quick decisions during projects was very easy for me to adapt to because of the agile environment that we worked in was pretty similar to how life in the military is. </p>
